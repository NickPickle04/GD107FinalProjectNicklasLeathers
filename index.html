<p class= "aboutp"> I am currently a student at COS majoring in Studio Arts for transfer. I plan on getting my BFA in graphic design with a focus on illustration! I want to get into character design for careers in tv, movies, or video games. Scroll down to see some of my works and inspirations! </p>
<p class="profp"> "Press X to Exit" was made in a Color and Design class and was accepted into the COS art gallery's 2025 exhibition!<br><br>"Tiger's Domain" was made for a similar class!<br><br>The Rainbow Brew menu was made for a free coffee event for the Source LGBTQ+ center.</p>
<p class="haringp"> Keith Haring was a pop-artist and queer activist that rose to fame in the 1980s. His art is kept simple yet has deeper meaning beyond the "childish" aesthetic. He also used his art to bring more awareness to the AIDS crisis. Haring preached the philosophy of art being for everyone of any age.</p>
<p class="vangoghp">Vincent Van Gogh needs little introduction. His art is something I've grown up around with my family also liking his work. My favorite is "Starry Night". I've always appreciated his impressionist style that can both represent real life and exagerate it at the same time. The saturated colors bring it all together for me!</p>
<p class="animationp"> I've always been fond of animation/cartoons. It's what I grew up watching and it still makes up a majority of my tv/movie screen time! I'm especially fond of 2D animation. A couple of my favorites include Avatar the Last Airbender, Nightmare Before Christmas, Cowboy Bebop, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and so so much more.</p>
